### Folder Explanations

- **admin/**: Contains all administrative interface files with permission-based access control
- **database/**: SQL schemas and migration scripts for database setup and updates
- **src/**: Core application logic, configuration, translations, and shared components
- **uploads/**: Storage directory for product images with security protection

## Installation & Setup

### Requirements

- PHP 8.2 or higher
- MySQL 5.7+ or MariaDB 10.2+
- Apache web server with mod_rewrite enabled (or Nginx)
- Minimum 128MB PHP memory limit
- File upload support enabled in PHP

### Step 1: Clone the Project

```bash
# Clone or download the project to your web server directory
cd /path/to/xampp/htdocs
# Extract or clone the project
```

### Step 2: Database Setup

1. Create a new MySQL database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE bloom_vine CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

2. Import the base schema:

```bash
mysql -u root -p bloom_vine < database/schema.sql
```

Or use phpMyAdmin to import `database/schema.sql`.

3. Run additional migrations (optional but recommended):

```bash
# For admin permissions system
php database/run_admin_permissions_migration.php

# For delivery date feature
php database/run_delivery_date_migration.php

# For payment method feature
php database/run_payment_method_migration.php
```

### Step 3: Configure Database Connection

Edit `src/config/db.php` and update the database credentials:

```php
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
define('DB_NAME', 'bloom_vine');
define('DB_USER', 'your_username');
define('DB_PASS', 'your_password');
```

### Step 4: Set File Permissions

Ensure the `uploads/` directory is writable:

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
chmod 755 uploads/
```

**Windows:**
Right-click the `uploads` folder → Properties → Security → Edit → Add write permissions for the web server user.

### Step 5: Configure Web Server

**Apache (XAMPP/WAMP):**
- The `.htaccess` file is already configured
- Ensure `mod_rewrite` is enabled in Apache configuration
- Restart Apache

**Nginx:**
Configure your server block to point to the project root directory.

### Step 6: Access the Application

- **Customer Site**: `http://localhost/flower-store/`
- **Admin Panel**: `http://localhost/flower-store/admin/dashboard.php`

### Default Credentials

**Regular Admin:**
- Email: `admin@bloomvine.com`
- Password: `admin123`

**Super Admin:**
- Email: `superadmin@bloomvine.com`
- Password: `superadmin123`

**IMPORTANT**: Change these credentials immediately after first login!

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
- All user inputs sanitized using `strip_tags()` and `trim()`
- Email validation using `filter_var()` with `FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL`
- Numeric inputs validated with type casting
- File upload validation for type and size

### SQL Injection Protection
- PDO with prepared statements and named parameters
- No direct SQL query concatenation
- Parameterized queries for all database operations
- Input validation before database operations

### Password Hashing
- ARGON2ID algorithm (most secure PHP hashing algorithm)
- Automatic salt generation
- Password verification using `password_verify()`
- Passwords never stored in plain text

### Session Management
- Secure session configuration
- Session regeneration on login
- CSRF token validation on all forms
- Session timeout handling
- Proper session destruction on logout

### XSS Prevention
- All output sanitized with `htmlspecialchars()`
- Helper function `e()` for consistent sanitization
- ENT_QUOTES flag to escape both single and double quotes
- UTF-8 encoding specified

### File Upload Security
- Allowed file types: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP
- Maximum file size: 5MB (configurable)
- File type validation using `mime_content_type()`
- Unique filename generation to prevent overwrites
- Upload directory outside document root (recommended)

### Access Control
- Role-based access (customer, admin, super_admin)
- Permission-based access for admin features
- `requireLogin()`, `requireAdmin()`, `requireSuperAdmin()` functions
- `requirePermission()` for granular control
- Automatic redirection for unauthorized access

### CSRF Protection
- Token generation using `random_bytes()`
- Token stored in session
- Token validation on all POST requests
- Token comparison using `hash_equals()` to prevent timing attacks
